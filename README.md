# Proyecto-de-Transfer-Learning
Transfer learning project developed as part of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãbootcamp. We applied fine-tuning techniques to pre-trained models to solve a real-world problem using a small dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how to repurpose existing models to achieve effective results in a short period of time.

# Transfer Learning Project - [Art Classifier]

This project was developed as part of the Transfer Learning module of an Artificial Intelligence bootcamp. Over the course of three days, our team applied fine-tuning techniques on a pre-trained model to address a specific problem that we are passionate about.

## Project Objective

To develop a Transfer Learning-based model to [insert clear and concise objective here, such as: detect emotions in tweets, classify diseased plant leaves, recognize facial expressions, etc.].

## Motivation

We believe that leveraging pre-trained models democratizes the use of artificial intelligence by enabling complex problem-solving even with limited data. This project allowed us to explore this potential and better understand how to adapt existing models to new tasks.

## Methodology

1. **Problem and Dataset Selection**
   - Problem: [Brief description]
   - Dataset: [Name and source of the dataset]
   - Number of classes: [X]
   - Approximate samples per class: [~N]

2. **Selected Pre-trained Model**
   - Model: [e.g., BERT, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, etc.]
   - Source: [HuggingFace / TensorFlow Hub / PyTorch Hub / etc.]

3. **Adaptations and Fine-tuning**
   - Custom classification layers
   - Fine-tuning strategy
   - Data augmentation (if applicable)

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers (for NLP projects)
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

## Expected Results

- Validation accuracy: [e.g., 85%]
- Loss and accuracy curves
- Confusion matrix
- Error analysis

## Conclusions

- Advantages of Transfer Learning in low-data scenarios
- Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
- Potential next steps with more time or data
