# Proyecto-de-Transfer-Learning
Transfer learning project developed as part of the AI ​​bootcamp. We applied fine-tuning techniques to pre-trained models to solve a real-world problem using a small dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how to repurpose existing models to achieve effective results in a short period of time.
